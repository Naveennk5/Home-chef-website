            <p>1.<b> Capacity for Larger Orders</b>:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Cars have more space than bikes, enabling the delivery of larger orders or multiple orders in one trip, catering to families or groups.</p>
            <p>2.<b> Weather Protection</b>:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Cars offer protection from adverse weather conditions, ensuring that food stays fresh and intact during transportation, regardless of rain or extreme temperatures.</p>

            <p>3.<b> Comfortable and Convenient</b>:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Customers can expect a more comfortable delivery experience, as cars provide a controlled environment with seating and space for the delivery personnel.</p>

            <p>4.<b> Extended Range</b>:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;     Cars can cover longer distances than bikes, making them suitable for suburban areas or locations further away from the restaurant or kitchen.</p>

            <p>5.<b> Versatility</b>:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Cars can be used for both food delivery and ride-sharing services, providing businesses with additional revenue streams and flexibility in operations.</p>
